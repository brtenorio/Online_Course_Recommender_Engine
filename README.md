# Personalized Online Course Recommender System with Machine Learning

Summary:
The "Personalized Online Course Recommender System with Machine Learning" project focuses on enhancing the learning experience of users on a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform called AI Training Room. The project aims to provide personalized course recommendations to learners in order to help them discover new courses of interest and optimize their learning paths. 

Currently, in the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase, the project involves exploring and comparing different machine learning models to identify the most effective one through offline evaluations. AI Training Room, a rapidly growing MOOCs startup with millions of users, looks to leverage machine learning techniques to tailor course recommendations and improve user engagement.
